3. Select an active Sim  
4. Open the phone UI  
5. Select “Take Selfie” from the camera options  
6. Complete the selfie process

The Sim takes the selfie, then returns to idle or continues gameplay normally.

## Actual Result:
After the selfie, the Sim becomes unresponsive and freezes in place. Time and UI remain functional, but the Sim does not resume behavior or respond to player commands.
