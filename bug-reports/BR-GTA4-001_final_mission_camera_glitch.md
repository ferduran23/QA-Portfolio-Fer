# Bug Report: Final Mission Unplayable Due to Camera Glitch – GTA IV (Xbox Series S)

**ID:** BR-GTA4-001  
**Title:** GTA IV – Final Mission 'A Revenger's Tragedy' Cannot Be Completed Due to Camera Glitch During Helicopter QTE  
**Severity:** High  
**Reproducibility:** 5/5  
**Platform:** Xbox Series S  
**Game Version:** GTA IV v.18.627.10.19  
**Mode:** Story Mode – Mission #89  
**Environment:** Backward Compatible Title, FPS: 60 (upscaled from original 30 FPS)

## Description

During Mission #89 (*A Revenger’s Tragedy*), the game becomes unplayable during the final quick-time event (QTE). When the player attempts to board the helicopter by pressing `A`, the camera begins switching erratically without player input. This disrupts gameplay and prevents successful completion of the mission.

The issue appears to be tied to the increased frame rate on Xbox Series S/X under backward compatibility. The bug blocks progression and soft-locks the player at a critical story point.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Launch GTA IV v.18.627.10.19 on Xbox Series S  
2. Start Mission #89 – *A Revenger’s Tragedy*  
3. Progress through the mission to the motorcycle chase segment  
4. Attempt to jump into the helicopter and press `A` as prompted  

## Expected Result

Niko grabs onto the helicopter, climbs aboard, and the mission progresses normally.

## Actual Result

The camera rapidly switches between angles uncontrollably during the QTE, causing input disruptions. Niko is unable to grab the helicopter, preventing mission completion.

## Notes

- This issue only occurs on Xbox Series S/X due to increased FPS under backward compatibility.
- Not reproducible on original Xbox 360 hardware.
