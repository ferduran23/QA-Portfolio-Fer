## Description

Teen Sims autonomously attempting to attend high school become stuck in a loop where they leave the lot, immediately return, and then try to leave again. They never successfully attend class, which negatively impacts their academic performance. This issue occurs across multiple households and save files, with or without mods installed.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Launch The Sims 4  
2. Load a household with at least one Teen Sim  
3. Wait until the school day begins  
4. Allow the Sim to autonomously go to school  

---

## Expected Result

The Teen Sim leaves the lot, attends school, and returns home after the school day ends.

---

## Actual Result

The Sim leaves the lot briefly, returns immediately, and repeatedly attempts to go to school without ever attending.
